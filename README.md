# Rubiks-Cube-Solver

````markdown

A fully interactive **3x3 Rubik’s Cube solver** built using **Python**, powered by **Kociemba’s Two-Phase Algorithm**, and presented with a user-friendly **Tkinter GUI**. Designed for **AeroHack 2025**, this project emphasizes accuracy, error handling, and a visual experience for cube solving.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Interactive GUI** with color-coded stickers
- 🔄 Simulates all 18 valid Rubik’s Cube moves (e.g., `U`, `D'`, `F2`)
- 🧩 Supports accurate cube modeling using 3x3 matrix per face
- 🧠 Solves scrambled cubes using **Kociemba’s optimal algorithm**
- ⚠️ Real-time input validation (ensures exactly 9 stickers per color)
- ✅ Detects **already solved cube** and skips solving
- ❌ Provides descriptive error messages for malformed input
